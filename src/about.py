This is sometimes called post-COVID-19 syndrome or '[long COVID](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/long-term-effects-of-coronavirus-long-covid/)'. COVID-19 survivors at all degrees of disease severity, including younger people, children, and those who are not hospitalized, are affected by this long COVID sickness, which is little understood. Many researchers have found that fatigue and difficulty breathing, which can last for months following exposure to COVID-19, are the most prevalent symptoms. Cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint aches, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac difficulties are all possible persistent symptoms of long COVID.

    <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:#216fdb;text-align:left;">What is this App about?</h2>
    
    This project aims to build a long COVID emotion analyzer. The application can analyze how people react to the long COVID and what are their emotions. The application can find out the trends of keywords used by people regarding the long COVID issues. The application can also analyze the emotion from the user input text. 

    
    <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;font-size:20px;color:#216fdb;text-align:left;">Who is this App for?</h2>

    <p>Anyone can use this App completely for free! The target users are the people who are concerned about long COVID issues and long COVID patients. If you are interest in finding out how people feel about the pandemic and long COVID issues, this application would be a good choice for you to explore.
